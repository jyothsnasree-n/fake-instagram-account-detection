# 📱 Fake Instagram Account Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
Fake Instagram accounts are widely used for spam, scams, fake engagement, and spreading misinformation.  
This project uses Machine Learning algorithms to classify Instagram accounts as **Real** or **Fake** based on profile-level features.

The system analyzes account characteristics and predicts authenticity using classification models.
